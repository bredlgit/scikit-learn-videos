    "\n",
    "1. Features and response to be passed into the ML model as **separate objects**\n",
    "    - iris.data and iris.target fufill this requirement as they are stored separately\n",
    "2. Features and response objects should only be **numeric**\n",
    "    - This is why iris.target is stored as 0's. 1's and 2's instead of the strings setosa, versicolor, & virginica\n",
    "    - This condition must always be met for both Regression and Classification problems\n",
    "3. Features and response should be stored as **NumPy arrays**\n",
    "    - Numpy is a library for scientific computing that implements a homogenous multi-dimensional array, known as an ndarray, that has been optimised for fast computation\n",
    "    - See below, iris.target and isris.data are already ndarrays\n",
    "4. Features and response should have **specific shapes**\n",
    "    - Specifically, the feature object should have two dimensions in which the first dimension, represented by rows, is the number of observations and the second dimension, represented by columns, is the number of features\n",
    "    - All Numpy arrays have a shape attribute so that we can verify that the shape of iris.data is 150 x 4\n",
    "    - The response object is expected to have a single dimension and that dimension should have the same magnitude as the first dimension of the feature object ie there should be one response corresponding to each observation\n",
    "    - We can see below that the shape of iris.target is indeed 150"
