    "1. First, train a **machine learning model** using **labeled data**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - \"Labeled data\" has been labeled with the outcome\n",
    "        - In the case of the email example, this labelling would be \"ham\" or \"spam\"\n",
    "        - This is called \"model training\" because the model is learning the relationship between the attributes of the data and the outcome.\n",
    "        - These attributes might include the message text, the number of embedded links, the length of the message etc\n",
    "    - \"Machine learning model\" learns the relationship between the attributes of the data and its outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, make **predictions** on **new data** for which the label is unknown\n",
    " - When a new email message arrives you want your trained model to accurately predict whether the email is \"ham\" or \"spam\" without a human examining it\n",
    " \n",
    "The model is learning from past examples, made up of inputs and outputs and then applying what it has learned to future inputs in order to predict future outputs. Because you are making predictions on unseen data, data that was not used to train the model it is often said that the primary goal of supervised learning is to build models that generalise ie you want to build machine learning models that will accurately predict the labels of your future emails rather than accurately predicting the labels of emails that you have already received\n",
